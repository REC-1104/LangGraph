      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was first introduced in 2020 by Douwe Kiela, Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, and Sebastian Riedel in their research paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks, at Meta.\n",

    "ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting):\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "- Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "- Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "- Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "- Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "- Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "- Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original task: “Calculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.”\n",
    "- Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "- Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",
    "- Result: \"There are 28 apples.\"\n",
    "- Reasoning: \"I am done.\""

    "\n",
    "This approach allows the AI to ask itself follow-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. It performs a recursive questioning process to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",
    "Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search (e.g., through Google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating a response.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Receive a complex question.\n",
    "- Step 2: The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
    "- Step 3: It performs a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources (like a web search).\n",
    "- Step 4: The answers are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",

    "Key points:\n",
